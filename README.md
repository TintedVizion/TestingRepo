# TestingRepo
Just something to get my bearings straight when using this.

This is my first README.md file

In the the computer world I go by the name of Tintillian or Tint for short.

The things that I make in the digital world I refer to as Tints Vizion.

Or when referring to the collective of creations, I refer to it as Tinted Vizion.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk...
